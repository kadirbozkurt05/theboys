            <br>
            <span class="font-warning"> <a href="#boys">The Boys</a> </span>  is an irreverent take on the superhero genre. It explores what happens when superheroes abuse their powers 
            instead of using them for good. These mighty beings — who are popular as celebrities, as influential as politicians, 
            and as revered as gods — find themselves hunted by a non-powered group of vigilantes.
            A CIA black-ops team, their job is to police, monitor and potentially stop <span class="font-warning"><a href="#seven">the Seven</a></span> , a group of vainglorious superheroes. 
            They were founded by Billy Butcher, their current leader.
            This band of brothers is out to expose the corruption they believe the Seven represent. Although they may not have superpowers, 
            they do have a lot of "blue-collar grit and [a] willingness to fight dirty."

          <p> He is the leader of the eponymous team of vigilantes who are bent on taking down Vought and the Seven by whatever 
            means necessary. A former member of the British special forces turned vigilante; Billy Butcher is as charming as he 
            is cunning. He's a force of nature, who can talk almost anyone into anything, either through a smile or brute force – 
            or sometimes both. He's consumed by one mission in life: to destroy superheroes. But this personal vendetta is driven 
            by his hatred for one Supe in particular: Homelander. Butcher is determined to get revenge on Homelander, no matter the 
            cost, and he won't let anyone, or anything stand in his way. Following the revelation that Becca is alive, Butcher faces a 
            difficult decision when he must choose between searching 
            for Becca or protecting the security of the Boys. He is portrayed by New Zealand actor Karl Urban as an adult, and by Luca 
            Villacis as a teenager.</p>

          <p>He is a member of the The Boys, an anti-superhero watchdog group whose ultimate goal is to take down Vought International 
            and the corrupt Supes they own by any means necessary. Not too long ago, Hughie led a pretty unremarkable and mediocre life. 
            He was a mild-mannered guy with a boring job at a small electronics store, who still lives at home with his father Hugh Campbell 
            Sr. in the same bedroom he grew up in. The only light in his life is the love of his life: his girlfriend Robin. That is, until 
            a speedster superhero named A-Train runs through Robin, eviscerating and killing her on impact. Desperate for revenge, Hughie 
            is recruited by anti-Supe vigilante Billy Butcher and his world is turned upside down when he finds himself caught in the middle 
            of a war against superheroes – who, as it turns out, are neither super nor heroic.</p>

          <p> "Mother's Milk" or "M.M" forms the heart of the team, and is almost always the only one of them to keep both a cool head 
            and his senses in compromising situations. Stylish and street smart, Milk displays a penchant for classic West Coast Hip Hop 
            shirts. Possessing vast wisdom of the more traditional kind, when The Boys find themselves in a sticky situation, or acting 
            out of character, Milk bestows this wisdom upon them, either to inspire them, or set them on a better path. 
            After his grandfather was killed by a Supe, and his father subsequently died of stress trying to seek justice, Milk became 
            determined to bring down Vought and expose the crimes of all superheroes. Though a member of the Boys, Milk worries that
             Billy Butcher’s win-at-all-cost pursuit of Homelander will put lives at risk—especially the people he cares about. As a 
             result, the two bump heads more than regularly.</p>

            <p>Serge, better known as Frenchie, is one of the three tritagonists of the Amazon series The Boys (along with Mother's 
                Milk and The Female), serving as a major character in both Seasons 2 and 3, and the tritagonist of Season 1.
                A drug-dabbling, gunrunning jack-of-all-trades, Frenchie’s skillsets are an invaluable resource to Butcher and 
                The Boys, but his impulsive decisions are an eternal source of frustration to Mother's Milk. Frenchie’s got a history 
                as a killer-for-hire — and those jobs, and the human faces behind them, have always stayed with him, like scars. But 
                he’ll rediscover his humanity when he finds a woman locked in a cage in a basement who’s part of a larger mystery, 
                and Frenchie is the only one of The Boys who’s able to connect with her.</p>

          <p> Kimiko Miyashiro, or simply The Female, is one of the three tritagonists (alongside Frenchie and Mother's Milk) of the Amazon 
            series The Boys, serving as a major character in both Seasons 1 and 3, and the tritagonist of Season 2. She is a member of the 
            vigilante group known as The Boys. When The Boys find her imprisoned in a cage in a basement under high security, they mistake
             her for a victim in desperate need of saving. But as The Boys unravel the mystery surrounding her, they follow a trail of blood 
             and gore to learn that she’s a badass who might just end up saving them instead.
            And as they’ll discover, the puzzle of her origins is part of something larger and far more terrifying than they ever imagined.</p>
